        <h1>About Dezmond Rosier</h1>
        <p class="lead">Dezmond Rosier is the right candidate for this moment in Charles County. He is running for County Commissioner in District 1, which includes Bel Alton, Port Tobacco, Welcome, Dentsville, and the southern Route 301 corridor just outside the county seat of La Plata. This district represents the heart of Southern Charles County communities rich in history, agricultural heritage, small businesses, and families who care deeply about preserving their quality of life while preparing for responsible growth.
          While District 1 has become increasingly competitive in recent election cycles, it has continued to support Democratic values in Charles county. Voters here are looking for someone who understands both the traditions that define the district and the forward-thinking solutions needed to address today’s challenges, from infrastructure and economic development to education, public safety, and smart land use.
          Dezmond brings a new generation of leadership grounded in real community experience. He has worked across Charles County and Maryland to connect residents with resources, expand civic engagement, and advocate for policies that strengthen needs and wants. His approach is collaborative, solutions-driven, and focused on results not rhetoric.
          At a time when many political conversations are stuck in the past, Dezmond is focused on the possibilities of our future: building an economy that works for working families, ensuring county government is accessible and responsive, investing in young people, and protecting the character of our communities as they grow. Dezmond believes leadership is not about holding a title it’s about showing up, listening, and delivering for the people you serve.
          That’s why Dezmond Rosier is not just running for office. He’s running to keep his home HOME!

        <h2>Deep Roots in Charles County</h2>
        <p>Dezmond Rosier is a proud son of La Plata, Maryland, born and raised on his family's Black-owned farm. His family's history in Charles County spans generations. On his mother's side, his roots are deeply embedded in Southern Maryland, with family heritage that also includes immigration from Poland and Italy. On his father's side, his lineage traces back to Charles County through the transatlantic slave trade and Native American ancestry.</p>
        <p>Growing up, Dezmond was shaped by the example of his grandparents—one a United States Marine, the other a member of the Maryland State Police—who instilled in him the values of service, discipline, and commitment to community at an early age.</p>
        <p>Dezmond attended Walter J. Mitchell Elementary School, Milton M. Somers Middle School, and is a graduate of La Plata High School. As a first-generation college graduate, he went on to earn his degree from Howard University, studying political science and economics. His life story reflects both the challenges and opportunities faced by many families in District 1—and fuels his determination to expand opportunity for others.</p>
        
        <h2>Proven Leadership and Strategic Action</h2>
        <p>Dezmond Rosier is a proven leader whose career is defined by principled advocacy and strategic action. His leadership first gained countywide attention when he organized a youth-led rally at the Charles County Courthouse, mobilizing hundreds to demand systemic reform and social justice.</p>
        <p>That momentum carried into his role as President of the local NAACP Youth Council, where he helped organize the historic Champions of Civil Rights graduation—finally awarding diplomas to La Plata High School alumni who were denied them in 1969. This work cemented his reputation as a leader who turns community advocacy into real outcomes.</p>
        <p>At Howard University, Dezmond continued that commitment to service as a student body president, overseeing budgets, expanding student opportunities, and leading complex collaborations with venture capital firms, nonprofit organizations, and the Office of the Vice President. His ability to navigate institutions while remaining grounded in the needs of people defines his leadership style.</p>
        <p>In 2021, Dezmond's political acumen was further recognized with his appointment to the Maryland Democratic Central Committee, where he gained firsthand experience in state and local governance.</p>
        
        <h2>A People-First Vision for District 1</h2>
        <p>Now, Dezmond is challenging the status quo by running for County Commissioner in District 1—bringing a record of mobilization, integrity, and forward-thinking leadership to the race.</p>
        <p>His campaign is centered on a people-first governing approach that prioritizes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Working families</li>
          <li>Utility affordability</li>
          <li>Smart, responsible development</li>
          <li>Workforce opportunity</li>
          <li>Protecting the rural character of District 1 communities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where the incumbent has focused on maintaining existing systems, Dezmond is focused on building forward-looking solutions that meet the needs of today's residents while preparing for future generations.</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Ultimately, this race represents a clear choice: maintaining the status quo or investing in new leadership. Dezmond Rosier will put District 1 families, workers, and communities first—while the incumbent continues to represent the old way of doing politics.</strong></p>
