        <h1>About Dezmond Campaign</h1>
        <p class="lead">Dezmond Rosier is the right candidate for this moment in Charles County. He is running for County Commissioner in District 1, which includes Bel Alton, Port Tobacco, Welcome, Dentsville, and the southern Route 301 corridor just outside the county seat of La Plata. This district represents the heart of Southern Charles County communities rich in history, agricultural heritage, small businesses, and families who care deeply about preserving their quality of life while preparing for responsible growth.
          While District 1 has become increasingly competitive in recent election cycles, it has continued to support Democratic values in Charles county. Voters here are looking for someone who understands both the traditions that define the district and the forward-thinking solutions needed to address today’s challenges, from infrastructure and economic development to education, public safety, and smart land use.
          Dezmond brings a new generation of leadership grounded in real community experience. He has worked across Charles County and Maryland to connect residents with resources, expand civic engagement, and advocate for policies that strengthen needs and wants. His approach is collaborative, solutions-driven, and focused on results not rhetoric.
          At a time when many political conversations are stuck in the past, Dezmond is focused on the possibilities of our future: building an economy that works for working families, ensuring county government is accessible and responsive, investing in young people, and protecting the character of our communities as they grow. Dezmond believes leadership is not about holding a title it’s about showing up, listening, and delivering for the people you serve.
          That’s why Dezmond Rosier is not just running for office. He’s running to keep his home HOME!

        </p>

        
        <h2>Deep Roots in Charles County</h2>
        <p>Dezmond Rosier is a proud son of La Plata, Maryland, born and raised on his family’s Black-owned farm, where he learned early the values of hard work, responsibility, and community stewardship. Growing up surrounded by the land his family cultivated for generations instilled in him a deep respect for Southern Maryland’s agricultural heritage and a firsthand understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing local families and community. His family’s ties to Charles County stretch back generations, grounding him in a legacy shaped by perseverance, faith, and service. Dezmond roots are more than family history; they are the reason Dezmond believes in service, civic engagement, and building bridges across backgrounds and perspectives. They shape his belief that leadership should be grounded in lived experience, guided by empathy, and focused on creating opportunity for the next generation.</p>
        <p>Growing up, Dezmond was deeply shaped by the example set by his grandparents—one grandfather a United States Marine, the other a member of the Maryland State Police, and his loving grandmothers, whose strength, wisdom, and steady presence anchored the family. Together, they represented the very best of what it means to live a life grounded in service, discipline, faith, and integrity. From them, he learned early that character is built not only through words, but through consistent action, humility, and a genuine commitment to others. Those lessons did not stay in childhood; they became the foundation of his character and continue to guide his approach to leadership today. Whether in his work, his civic engagement, or his commitment to public service, Dezmond carries forward the legacy his grandparents modeled—striving to serve with honor, lead with humility, and make a meaningful difference in the lives of others.</p>
        <p>
          Dezmond attended Walter J. Mitchell Elementary School, Milton M. Somers Middle School, and graduated from La Plata High School, where he developed an early interest in leadership, civic engagement, and community service. His educational journey reflects the same path taken by many young people in Charles County’s District 1, giving him a firsthand understanding of the experiences, aspirations, and challenges local students and families navigate every day.
          As a first-generation college graduate, Dezmond went on to earn his degree from Howard University, where he studied political science and economics fields that sharpened his understanding of public policy, economic growth, and the systems that shape people’s lives. His time at Howard not only strengthened his academic foundation but also deepened his commitment to public service and community empowerment, preparing him to lead with both knowledge and purpose.
          His life story reflects both the challenges and opportunities of working hard to create new opportunities to breaking barriers. Dezmonds  journey fuels his determination to ensure others have access to the same opportunities and more. Dezmond believes that where you start should never limit how far you can go, and he is committed to expanding pathways to success for students, families, and future generations across Charles County.

        <h2>Proven Leadership and Strategic Action</h2>
        <p>Dezmond Rosier is a proven leader whose career is defined by principled advocacy and strategic action. His leadership first gained countywide attention when he organized a youth-led rally at the Charles County Courthouse, mobilizing hundreds to demand systemic reform and social justice.</p>
        <p>That momentum carried into his role as President of the local NAACP Youth Council, where he helped organize the historic Champions of Civil Rights graduation—finally awarding diplomas to La Plata High School alumni who were denied them in 1969. This work cemented his reputation as a leader who turns community advocacy into real outcomes.</p>
        <p>At Howard University, Dezmond continued that commitment to service as a student body president, overseeing budgets, expanding student opportunities, and leading complex collaborations with venture capital firms, nonprofit organizations, and the Office of the Vice President. His ability to navigate institutions while remaining grounded in the needs of people defines his leadership style.</p>
        <p>In 2021, Dezmond's political acumen was further recognized with his appointment to the Maryland Democratic Central Committee, where he gained firsthand experience in state and local governance.</p>
        
        <h2>A People-First Vision for District 1</h2>
        <p>Now, Dezmond is challenging the status quo by running for County Commissioner in District 1—bringing a record of mobilization, integrity, and forward-thinking leadership to the race.</p>
        <p>His campaign is centered on a people-first governing approach that prioritizes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Working families</li>
          <li>Utility affordability</li>
          <li>Smart, responsible development</li>
          <li>Workforce opportunity</li>
          <li>Protecting the rural character of District 1 communities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where the incumbent has focused on maintaining existing systems, Dezmond is focused on building forward-looking solutions that meet the needs of today's residents while preparing for future generations.</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Ultimately, this race represents a clear choice: maintaining the status quo or investing in new leadership. Dezmond Rosier will put District 1 families, workers, and communities first—while the incumbent continues to represent the old way of doing politics.</strong></p>
